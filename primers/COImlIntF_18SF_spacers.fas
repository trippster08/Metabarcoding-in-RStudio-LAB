# This is the fasta file called in Cutadapt to search for multiple Forward primers.
  # Each primer sequence is preceded by an X. This X indicates that the primer is 
  # found at the 5' end of the sequence (a non-internal primer). It is similar to an
  # anchored primer, except the entire primer sequence does not need to be found.
