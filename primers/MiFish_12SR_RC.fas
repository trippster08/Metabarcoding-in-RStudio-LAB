# This is the fasta file called in Cutadapt to search for the reverse complement
# of the Reverse primers at the 3' end of R1. This primer does not have to
# actually be at very the of the read (if there is illumina adapter sequence,
# spacers or barcodes 3'-wards of the primer). Also, this primer is not
# necessary: ff this primer is not found, it won't affect whether the read is
# kept or removed.
