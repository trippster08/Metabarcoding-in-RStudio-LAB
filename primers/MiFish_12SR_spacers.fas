# This is the fasta file called in Cutadapt to search for multiple Reverse primers.
	# Each primer sequence is preceded by an X. This X indicates that the primer is 
	# found at the 5' end of the sequence and is required (it is an anchored primer).
	# Anchored primers are mandatory in full, and if this primer is not found,
	# the read will be removed. 
# These are the 12S MiFish metabarcoding primer, with spacers from
  # the Travis Glenn lab
