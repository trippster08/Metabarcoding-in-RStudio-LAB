# This is the fasta file called in Cutadapt to search for multiple Forward primers.
  # Each primer sequence is preceded by an ^. This ^ indicates that the primer is 
  # anchored, which means it is found at the 5' end of the sequence, and is
  # required (i.e. the read will not be kept if the primer is not found).
